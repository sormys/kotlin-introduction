This repository contains solutions to programming tasks completed as part of a
Kotlin course at the University of Warsaw. The tasks were prepared by ≈Åukasz Wnuk.
Each branch (except `master`) contains the solution to a single task, with a brief description provided below.
- `blitz` - simulation of a two-player dice game involving attacker and defender roles.
Players take turns rolling a customizable die, optionally rerolling once per round.
The game continues until one reaches a target score. The implementation includes
multiple simulations with role switching and statistical analysis of outcomes.
- `smd-solution` - implementation of a Kotlin-based DSL for generating
Simple Markdown (SMD) documents. Supports headers,
paragraphs, line breaks, lists, horizontal rules, text formatting, inline
and block code. Includes a main function that renders a predefined document (`example.md`)
and writes it to a specified file.
- `seega-solution` - console-based Kotlin implementation of the Egyptian
board game Seega for two players. Supports interactive gameplay on 5x5, 7x7, or 9x9
boards with deploy and move commands. Displays the board and relevant game state
after each action.
